## Mersenne Primes and Hash Functions
They are prime numbers of the form **2<sup>k</sup> - 1**. 
In binary they'b be represent as all 1s, which makes life easier for us when hashing, modulo operations are costly and if we can use all 1s as for that, then we can eliminate the expensive modulo with bitwise operations and simple addition subtraction which is quite a lot faster.

2 Sections in and I'm lost in the maze of math, and I'll (hopefully) get to this again later. I've got to complete the book and it seems like this papaer is not that important to understanding hash_tables.
