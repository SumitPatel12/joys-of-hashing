## Random Stuff
- You'd need to identify if a bin/slot is in use or not. For that you can:
  - Either have a bit in the bins that indicates whether that bin is initialized or not. This however has big scope for space unerutilization since we can't have just one bit, so it'd either be 1 byte or more depending on the alignment setting of the machine you're using likely 32-bits or 64-bits out of which just 1 bit is useful, remainig 31 or 63 are just overhead.
  - OR, you can assign a value (from the possible values for the key) as a default value. That value will indicate that the bin is uninitialized. This has better space unerutilization, but you're letting go of one key from the range, so you'll have to make sure that the key you choose would never be generated by the end user. If they ever generate that default value, it'll never be represented correctly in the hash table.
